## Loading Data into BigQuery

This section describes how to load customer contact information into the BigQuery table `gemini_demo.customer_contact_info` using the `bq` command-line tool.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Google Cloud SDK:**
    * The Google Cloud SDK (which includes the `gcloud` CLI and `bq` tool) must be installed and configured.
    * Authenticate and set your default project by running:
        ```bash
        gcloud auth login
        gcloud config set project [Alchemy Project ID]
        ```
        Replace `[Alchemy Project ID]` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.

2.  **BigQuery Dataset:**
    * The target dataset `gemini_demo` must exist in your BigQuery project. If it doesn't, create it using the command:
        ```bash
        bq mk gemini_demo
        ```

3.  **Data Files:**
    * Prepare your data files: `customers.csv` for CSV import and `customers.ndjson` for Newline Delimited JSON import.
    * These files should be located in the directory where you run the `bq load` commands, or you must update the paths in the commands to point to the correct file locations.
    * The data in these files should conform to the following schema:
        * `customer_id`: INT64
        * `customer_name`: STRING
        * `phone_number`: STRING
        * `email_address`: STRING

### Loading Data from a CSV File

To load data from a CSV file (e.g., `customers.csv`) into the `gemini_demo.customer_contact_info` table, use the following command. This command assumes the CSV file has a header row (which will be skipped) and will replace the table if it already exists.

```bash
bq load \
    --source_format=CSV \
    --skip_leading_rows=1 \
    --replace=true \
    gemini_demo.customer_contact_info \
    ./customers.csv \
    customer_id:INT64,customer_name:STRING,phone_number:STRING,email_address:STRING
Command Options Explained:

--source_format=CSV: Specifies that the source file is in CSV format.
--skip_leading_rows=1: Instructs bq to skip the first row of the CSV file (typically the header row).
--replace=true: If the destination table already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the table does not exist, it will be created.
gemini_demo.customer_contact_info: The fully qualified name of the target BigQuery table (dataset.table).
./customers.csv: The path to your local CSV data file. Adjust if your file is located elsewhere.
customer_id:INT64,...: The schema definition for the table being loaded.
Loading Data from an NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) File
To load data from a Newline Delimited JSON file (e.g., customers.ndjson) into the gemini_demo.customer_contact_info table, use the command below. Each line in the customers.ndjson file should be a complete, valid JSON object. This command will replace the table if it already exists.

Bash

bq load \
    --source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON \
    --replace=true \
    gemini_demo.customer_contact_info \
    ./customers.ndjson \
    customer_id:INT64,customer_name:STRING,phone_number:STRING,email_address:STRING
Command Options Explained:

--source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON: Specifies that the source file is in Newline Delimited JSON format.
--replace=true: If the destination table already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the table does not exist, it will be created.
gemini_demo.customer_contact_info: The fully qualified name of the target BigQuery table.
./customers.ndjson: The path to your local NDJSON data file. Adjust if your file is located elsewhere.
customer_id:INT64,...: The schema definition for the table. (Note: For NDJSON, you can also use --autodetect to let BigQuery infer the schema, but providing it explicitly is often more reliable.)
Important Notes:

File Paths: Ensure the paths to ./customers.csv and ./customers.ndjson in the commands correctly point to your data files.
Permissions: The account used to run the bq commands must have the necessary IAM permissions to create and load data into BigQuery tables in the specified project and dataset.
Large Files: For very large data files, it's generally recommended to upload them to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) first and then load them into BigQuery using the GCS URI (e.g., gs://your-bucket-name/your-file-name.csv).
